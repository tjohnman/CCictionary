CCictionary
===========

### What is this?

A clean and convenient Chinese/English English/Chinese dictionary that uses CC-CEDICT. It aims to be clean without sacrificing being comfortable to use.

It's main highlights are:

- Smart search (use English, Chinese pinyin or hanzi interchangeably).
- Clean interface.
- Fast. Not that it is optimized, but it contains the least possible nonsense.
- It uses [CC-CEDICT](http://cc-cedict.org/wiki/), making it 100% free of hassles.
